# Build Instructions 

In the following we share the instructions to build and update the SQL Client Docker image for the 
Apache Flink SQl training (https://github.com/ververica/sql-training).

To build the sql-client image execute

```bash
./build.sh
```

from the root directory of this project.

The build script will download or build all required artifacts and bundle them in the Docker image.
